# FlinkDink Flashcards

This project is a simple flashcard app for toddlers built with **React**, **Vite**,
and **Tailwind CSS**. Content is organized in weekly JSON files and progress is
saved locally.

> **Heads up!** Tailwind v4 removes some classic utility classes such as `w-10`
> and `h-10`. If you see "unknown utility" errors during builds, use explicit CSS
> widths/heights or the new `size-*` utilities as shown below.

## Development

Install dependencies (including the `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin) and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This launches a hot-reloading dev server so you can iterate quickly.

Tailwind CSS is processed with `@tailwindcss/postcss`. If you see a build error
about unknown utilities (for example `bg-orange-500`), make sure the plugin is
installed and listed in `postcss.config.js`. When a particular utility still
fails to apply, replace it with an equivalent CSS declaration inside a `@layer`
block.

**Width/Height utilities**: Tailwind v4 removed some fixed width and height
classes like `w-10` and `h-10`. When upgrading you may see errors such as
`Cannot apply unknown utility class "w-10"`. Replace these with explicit CSS
properties (e.g. `width: 2.5rem; height: 2.5rem;`) or use the new `size-*`
utilities.

You can modify default styles by editing `tailwind.config.cjs`. Add new colors
or font families under the `extend` section. Reusable custom classes should be
placed inside the `@layer components` block in `src/index.css`.

Lint the code with ESLint:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Before running the tests make sure all dependencies are installed:

```bash
npm install
```

With everything installed you can run the Jest suite manually:

```bash
npm test
```

The `postinstall` script also invokes `npm test` automatically, so simply
running `npm install` will execute the suite in CI environments.

CI pipelines can also invoke `scripts/ci-test.sh` which installs
dependencies and runs the tests in one step.

The tests use **Jest** with **Supertest** and an in-memory SQLite database for
the API routes, while React components rely on **React Testing Library**.

## Project Structure

- `src/contexts` ‚Äì global `ContentProvider` that loads week data and tracks progress
- `src/modules` ‚Äì individual learning modules (Language, Math, Encyclopedia)
- `src/screens` ‚Äì page components for the router
- `public/weeks` ‚Äì JSON data files per week. Encyclopedia cards include a
  `query` field with an English search term used for fetching photos
- `src/utils/fetchWeek.js` ‚Äì helper to fetch a week's JSON by number
- `src/utils/fetchPhoto.js` ‚Äì fetches an Unsplash image for a given query
 - Language words now display in a very large lowercase font so toddlers
   can easily read them

## Progress Storage

User progress is stored in `localStorage` under the key `progress-v1`. Each saved record contains a `version` field. If the stored version does not match the current application version, progress is reset to defaults. Bump the version when changing the progress schema.

## Home Screen

The top of the page includes a sticky `NavBar` with a centered **FlinkDink**
title and a circular settings button. When viewing a session, the bar shows a
home icon on the left so you can navigate back.

Below the navigation is the main content area. A `Hero` component displays a
static headline and tagline welcoming toddlers to the flashcards.

Progress for the day is visualized by the `ProgressStrip` which renders three
session dots. Underneath, `ThemeList` previews upcoming module titles such as
Language, Math and Knowledge.

A large `CTAButton` starts or continues the current session depending on your
progress.

The math module's red dots are now styled inline with explicit dimensions so
they remain visible even if Tailwind utilities are unavailable. Math slides use
a sliding window of ten numbers; starting on week two the first five appear in a
random order while the upper five stay sequential.


## Navigation

The application now uses a `NavBar` component on the home screen. It shows a back/home icon, a centered **FlinkDink** title, and a circular settings button. Other screens continue to display the progress header with week, day, and session information.
Clicking the settings button now opens a simple **Dashboard** route showing overall progress and reset options.
Parents can also jump to any of the 52 weeks from the Dashboard. Selecting a week loads its curriculum or displays "empty" if no data exists.
When unlocked, the Dashboard now shows a large progress header with your current week, day, session and streak. It reuses the same session dots as the home screen.
Daily modules are listed in a small table labelled **"Weekly progress"**, where completed cells appear green.

Below the table is a row of control buttons arranged with `flex` and `flex-wrap` so they stack neatly on narrow screens. Each button label now starts with a small emoji, for example **"üîÑ Reset Today"** and **"üóëÔ∏è Reset All"**. Selecting **Reset All** opens a confirmation dialog before all progress is cleared.

## Accessibility

Carousel navigation buttons now include descriptive ARIA labels and retain their focus outlines for improved keyboard navigation.

Finishing a session triggers a short confetti toast before returning to the home screen. The animation respects the user's `prefers-reduced-motion` setting to reduce movement.

## Loading States

Most screens display a reusable skeleton placeholder while week data loads.
The skeleton uses an animated shimmer and sets `aria-busy="true"` for assistive technology. If loading fails, an error message is displayed.
Encyclopedia images are lazy loaded to keep initial renders snappy.


## Error Handling

When week data fails to load, a red banner appears below the header with the
HTTP status or message. The banner includes a **Retry** button that re-runs the
`loadWeek` request.

## Authentication

Run a small API server to handle login and registration requests:

```bash
npm run server
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```bash
PORT=3001
JWT_SECRET=your-secret
DB_PATH=./users.db
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key
UNSPLASH_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```

Create these keys by signing up for a developer account at [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/developers) and creating a new application. Add the generated Access Key and Secret Key to your `.env` as shown above. Keep both keys private and **never commit them to the repository**. The `/api/photos` proxy route must be running via `npm run server` for images to load during development.

The default credentials are **demo@example.com** / **password**. You can also
register a new account using the **Sign Up** page. Successful authentication
returns a token stored in `localStorage` by the `AuthProvider`.
Access this context via the `useAuth` hook exported from
`src/contexts/authHelpers.js`.

During development the API server runs on `http://localhost:3001`, so the
`VITE_API_BASE_URL` variable should point there. For production builds set it to
the full URL of your deployed API server.
The frontend reads this value via the `__API_BASE_URL__` constant defined by Vite.

### Photo Search API

`GET /api/photos?query=term` fetches the first Unsplash search result and returns a 640√ó360 face/entropy crop using the raw URL with Imgix parameters.
Search terms are sanitized by trimming leading and trailing whitespace before contacting Unsplash.
The server attempts several search phrases and falls back to `/images/placeholder.png` if none succeed:

1. A portrait-oriented shot of the breed
2. The breed on a white background
3. A clean studio-style image using "isolated minimal background"
4. A plain search using the breed name
It appends `w=640&h=360&fit=crop&crop=faces,entropy` to the Unsplash **raw** image URL so Imgix crops around faces or the most interesting region. If the original Unsplash link already includes query parameters, the cropping string is concatenated with `&` instead of `?`.
Without extra parameters the response has the shape `{ "small": "url", "regular": "url" }` where both URLs are identical.
Include a `format` query to receive a single `{ "url": "..." }` instead.
The server requires `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` in the environment. Queries for Afrikaans dog breed names are translated to their English equivalents so Unsplash can find matching photos.
Make sure this key is valid and that the server can reach `api.unsplash.com`. The `/api/photos` route requires outbound network access. If the request fails, the server falls back to `/images/placeholder.png` and responds with HTTP `404`.
If you use a proxy or have restricted egress, set the appropriate environment variables (e.g. `HTTPS_PROXY`) so outbound requests to Unsplash succeed.
If Unsplash has no results or a network error occurs, the endpoint responds with HTTP `404` and `{ "detail": "Unsplash request failed" }`.

```json
{
  "detail": "Unsplash request failed",
}
```
If the request fails on the client, the app falls back to `/images/placeholder.png`.
The file is not included in the repo; add your own placeholder image at `public/images/placeholder.png`.
### Interpreting Server Logs
The server uses the `morgan` middleware in the `combined` format to log every
incoming HTTP request. Each line shows the method, URL, response status and
response time. In addition, the generic error handler prints any unexpected
errors. If something goes wrong you'll see a message in the console and the API
responds with JSON like `{ "detail": "Database error" }` along with the relevant
status code.

## Mobile Usage

FlinkDink is a Progressive Web App. You can add it to your home screen from the
browser share menu or package it as a native app using **Capacitor**.

Math practice screens now size their dot container responsively using
`h-[60vw] sm:h-[40vh]`. Dots are positioned with a new algorithm that retries
until each one is at least eight percent away from the others, preventing
overlap on small displays.
Red dots specify their width, height and color inline so builds without
Tailwind still display them correctly.
The Dashboard now uses a responsive week grid that shows seven columns on small
screens and thirteen on larger displays. Each week button has a subtle hover
state, and the active week appears in bold with `aria-current="true"` for
accessibility. The carousel height now uses `min-h-[50vh]` and login/signup
forms are `w-full max-w-xs` so they fit on narrow devices. The PIN input on the
Dashboard also uses these classes so it stretches across narrow screens without
exceeding `max-w-xs`.
The progress table now uses `table-fixed` so its seven columns fit within a
360&nbsp;px wide viewport, and the action buttons are arranged in a single-column
grid that expands to four columns on larger screens.
Encyclopedia images now use an `.encyclopedia-thumb` class with
`aspect-ratio: 16 / 9` so photos scale consistently on mobile devices. This
matches the 640√ó360 smart-crop returned by `/api/photos`. A `zoom-img` class
adds a gentle scale animation on hover starting at the `md` breakpoint,
leaving touch devices unaffected.

Full-screen areas leverage viewport units so layouts adapt to device height.
The math board scales with the viewport width while carousels always take up at
least half of the viewport height. Week buttons switch between seven and
thirteen columns depending on the viewport width. Dots will never overlap
because positions are regenerated until the minimum eight percent spacing is
met.

**Small screen layout**: On a 360‚Äâpx wide phone the Dashboard displays two
short rows of seven week buttons with progress info below. The math practice
screen shows four non-overlapping dots inside a square area roughly 60‚Äâ% of the
viewport width. Forms and buttons stretch across the width but remain capped at
`max-w-xs`. These layouts were verified with browser device emulation to ensure
no horizontal scrolling occurs.

### Build for Android or iOS

Install Capacitor and sync the project:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npx cap sync
```

Before building the native projects, make sure a `.env` file exists in the
project root so both the frontend and API server share the correct values:

```bash
PORT=3001
JWT_SECRET=your-secret
DB_PATH=./users.db
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-server.com
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key
UNSPLASH_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```
Obtain your Unsplash credentials from the Unsplash Developer dashboard. Keep them private and do not commit them. Ensure the `/api/photos` proxy is running so images load correctly.

Whenever you change these variables run `npx cap sync` again so Capacitor copies
them into the platform folders.

Open the project in Android Studio or Xcode:

```bash
npx cap open android
npx cap open ios
```

From there you can build and publish the app to the Play Store or App Store. For
release builds remember to configure signing keys:

- **Android** ‚Äì create a keystore and reference it from
  `android/gradle.properties` or `signing.properties`.
- **iOS** ‚Äì add your certificates and provisioning profiles in Xcode.

The backend requires a Node.js environment with SQLite support. Deploy
`server.js` to a Node host (such as Railway or a small VPS) and ensure the
database file is writable. Update `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in your `.env` to point to
the deployed server.

## License

Images used in the encyclopedia module are stored locally under `public/images`.
Each file is a small SVG placeholder so the app works without internet access.
